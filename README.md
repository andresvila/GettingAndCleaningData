======================
This projects contains an analisis script that cleans data related to a Human Activity Recognition project.  More detailed information about the project can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The following files need to be in your working directory:

 1. X_test.txt
 2. subject_test.txt
 3. y_test.txt
 4. X_train.txt
 5. subject_train.txt
 6. y_train.txt
 7. features.txt
